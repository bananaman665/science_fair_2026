# Variety-Specific Apple Oxidation Models

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Improvement:** Separate models for different apple varieties

## üéØ Problem Identified

Our original combined model showed poor performance on Granny Smith apples (MAE: 1.90 days). Analysis revealed that different apple varieties oxidize at different rates:
- **Gala apples**: Oxidize faster, more visible browning
- **Granny Smith apples**: Oxidize slower, green color masks oxidation

## üî¨ Solution: Variety-Specific Models

We trained three separate models to handle this variety difference:

### Model Performance Summary

| Model | Training Data | Validation MAE | Test MAE (Granny Smith) |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Combined** | 88 photos (both varieties) | 1.395 days | 2.02 days |
| **Gala-specific** | 44 Gala photos | 0.750 days | 2.29 days |
| **Smith-specific** | 44 Granny Smith photos | 0.568 days | **1.47 days** |

### üèÜ Key Findings

1. **Smith-specific model performs 36% better than worst model**
   - MAE: 1.47 days vs 2.29 days (Gala model)
   - Reduced error from 2.02 days (combined) to 1.47 days
   
2. **Day 1 predictions are excellent** (Smith model)
   - smith1-day1: 1.11d predicted vs 1.0d actual (0.11d error) ‚úÖ
   - smith2-day1: 0.94d predicted vs 1.0d actual (0.06d error) ‚úÖ
   
3. **Days 2-4 still challenging** but improved
   - Smith model consistently outperforms other models
   - Still underestimates oxidation on older apples
   
4. **Wrong model makes it worse**
   - Gala model on Granny Smith: 2.29 days MAE
   - Combined model on Granny Smith: 2.02 days MAE
   - Smith model on Granny Smith: 1.47 days MAE

```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Training Script (`train_regression_model.py`)
- Trains three models: `combined`, `gala`, `smith`
- Filters training data by variety
- Saves separate model files:
  - `apple_oxidation_days_model_combined.h5`
  - `apple_oxidation_days_model_gala.h5`
  - `apple_oxidation_days_model_smith.h5`

### 2. API Updates (`apple_api_regression.py`)
- Loads all three models at startup
- Accepts `variety` parameter: `?variety=gala` or `?variety=smith`
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  # Use Granny Smith model
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze?variety=smith" \
       -F "file=@apple_photo.jpg"
  
  # Use Gala model
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze?variety=gala" \
       -F "file=@apple_photo.jpg"
  
  # Use combined model (default)
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze?variety=combined" \
       -F "file=@apple_photo.jpg"
  ```

### 3. Validation Testing (`test_single_apple.py`)
- Tests all three models simultaneously
- Compares performance across models
- Identifies best model for each photo
- Generates comparative visualizations

## üìà Improvement Path Forward

### Option 1: Collect More Granny Smith Data (Recommended)
- Current: 44 Granny Smith photos
- Goal: 100+ photos across 0-5 days
- Focus on Days 2-4 (currently weakest)
- Expected improvement: MAE < 1.0 day

### Option 2: Include Test Data in Training
- Add 8 validation photos to training set
- Retrain Smith model with 52 photos
- Re-test on NEW Granny Smith apples
- Quick improvement, validates approach

### Option 3: Environmental Calibration
- Track temperature during photo collection
- Add temperature as model input
- Account for oxidation rate variations
- More complex but potentially more accurate
