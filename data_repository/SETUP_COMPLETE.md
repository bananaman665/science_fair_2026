## 🚀 **Next Steps to Use This System**

### 1. **Set Up Google Drive API** (One-time setup)
```bash
cd data_repository/04_scripts
./sync_manager.sh
# Choose option 1: Setup Google Drive API credentials
```

**You'll need to:**
- Go to console.cloud.google.com
- Create/select a project
- Enable Google Drive API
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Download `credentials.json` to the scripts folder

### 2. **Start Data Collection**
```bash
# Navigate to your assigned round folder
cd data_repository/01_raw_images/round_1_[your_name]/

# Create your specific apple variety folders if needed
# Follow the data collection guidelines
# Save images with proper naming convention
```

### 3. **Sync to Google Drive**
```bash
cd data_repository/04_scripts
./sync_manager.sh
# Choose option 2: Upload to Google Drive
```

### 4. **Team Collaboration**
```bash
# Other team members can download latest data
./sync_manager.sh
# Choose option 3: Download from Google Drive
```
