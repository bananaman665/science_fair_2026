# Apple Oxidation Data Collection Guidelines
## Science Fair 2025 - Team Protocol

**Project:** Apple Oxidation Detection AI Model  
**Date Created:** September 20, 202- **Team Member:** ________________  
- **Apple Collection Date:** ___________ 
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

This document provides standardized procedures for collecting apple oxidation data to train our machine learning model. **Consistency is critical** - all team members must follow these guidelines exactly to ensure our dataset is reliable and our model performs well.

---

## Apple Varieties (Multi-Species Approach)

### Primary Target Varieties
We will collect data from **3 different apple varieties** to improve model robustness:

1. **Red Delicious** 
   - Reason: Most common variety, predictable oxidation pattern
   - Oxidation characteristics: Browns moderately, clear color progression

2. **Granny Smith**
   - Reason: Different baseline color (green), slower oxidation rate
   - Oxidation characteristics: Takes longer to brown, different color changes

3. **Gala**
   - Reason: Fast oxidation rate, good for time-lapse data
   - Oxidation characteristics: Browns quickly, dramatic color changes

### Why Multiple Varieties?
- **Model Robustness:** Handles different apple types in real-world usage
- **Color Variation:** Different baseline colors improve detection accuracy
- **Oxidation Rates:** Various browning speeds provide diverse training data
- **Real-World Application:** Users will photograph different apple types

## Equipment Checklist

### Required Items (per collection session)
- [ ] Fresh apples (3 varieties, 2 apples per variety)
- [ ] Sharp knife for consistent cutting
- [ ] Cutting board (white or light colored)
- [ ] Camera/smartphone with good quality
- [ ] Ruler or measuring tape
- [ ] Labels/markers for identification
- [ ] Timer/stopwatch
- [ ] Data collection sheet (see template below)
- [ ] Clean white plate or background
- [ ] Consistent lighting source

---

## Pre-Collection Setup

### Environment Preparation
1. **Location:** Choose a location with consistent lighting (near window with natural light OR consistent artificial lighting)
2. **Background:** Use white or light gray background for all photos
3. **Temperature:** Room temperature (68-72¬∞F / 20-22¬∞C)
4. **Timing:** Plan for 7-day collection period per apple set

### Apple Preparation
1. **Selection:** Choose apples that are:
   - Similar size within each variety
   - No visible bruises or dark spots
   - Firm texture
   - Fresh appearance

---

## Cutting Protocol

### Standardized Cutting Procedure
1. **Slice Thickness:** 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) thick
2. **Cut Direction:** Cut perpendicular to core (showing star pattern)
3. **Slice Position:** Use center slices (avoid end pieces)
4. **Number of Slices:** 3 slices per apple
5. **Core Removal:** Leave core visible in photos (natural reference point)

### Safety Guidelines
- Always cut away from your body
- Use sharp knife for clean cuts
- Adult supervision required for younger team members
- Clean knife between different apple varieties

---

## Photography Protocol

### Camera Settings
- **Resolution:** Minimum 8MP (smartphone quality acceptable)
- **Focus:** Ensure apple slice is in sharp focus
- **Flash:** NO flash - use natural/ambient lighting only
- **Format:** JPEG or PNG (avoid heavily compressed formats)

### Photo Composition
- **Distance:** 12-18 inches from apple slice
- **Angle:** Directly above (90-degree angle) for consistency
- **Background:** White plate or paper, no patterns
- **Framing:** Apple slice fills 60-80% of frame
- **Multiple Shots:** Take 3 photos per slice, use best quality image

### Lighting Requirements
- **Consistency:** Same lighting conditions for entire 7-day period
- **Quality:** Bright enough to see color details clearly
- **Shadows:** Minimize shadows on apple surface
- **Time of Day:** If using natural light, photograph at same time daily (recommend 10 AM - 2 PM)

---

## üß™ **IMPORTANT: Start with Pilot Study First**

**Before beginning full data collection, complete the 7-day Pilot Study** (see `Apple_Oxidation_Pilot_Study.md`). This will determine:
- Actual oxidation rates for each apple type at room temperature
- Optimal photo timing intervals (every 12 hours? 24 hours? 48 hours?)
- Whether oxidation is sufficient in 2-3 days or if we need 5-7 days
- Which apple varieties show the clearest oxidation progression

---

## Data Collection Schedule
*Note: This timeline should be adjusted based on pilot study results*

### Planned Timeline: Multi-Day Collection Period
- **Day 0:** Fresh cut (baseline photos within 15 minutes)
- **Day 1:** 24 hours after cutting
- **Day 2:** 48 hours after cutting
- **Day 3:** 72 hours after cutting *(may extend based on pilot)*
- **Day 4:** 96 hours after cutting *(if needed)*
- **Day 5:** 120 hours after cutting *(if needed)*
- **Day 6:** 144 hours after cutting *(if needed)*

### Daily Collection Time
- **Consistency:** Same time each day (¬± 1 hour)
- **Duration:** 15-30 minutes per variety
- **Order:** Photograph in same variety order each day
