# Team Training Presentation: Apple Oxidation Data Collection
## Science Fair 2025 - Training Guide

### Slide 1: Welcome & Project Overview
**Title: Apple Oxidation Detection AI - Data Collection Training**

**Project Goal:**
- Build AI model to detect apple oxidation levels from photos
- Train model using consistent, high-quality dataset
- Create mobile app for real-world oxidation detection

**Why Data Collection Matters:**
- Quality data = Better AI performance
- Consistency across team = Reliable results
- Proper protocol = Scientific validity

---

### Slide 2: The Science Behind Apple Oxidation
**What Causes Apple Oxidation?**
- Enzyme reaction when apple flesh meets oxygen
- Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme causes browning
- Rate varies by apple variety, temperature, pH

**Why Different Apple Varieties?**
- **Red Delicious:** Moderate oxidation rate, predictable pattern
- **Granny Smith:** Slower oxidation, different baseline color (green)
- **Gala:** Faster oxidation, dramatic color changes

**Scientific Benefit:** Model learns to handle variety of real-world scenarios

---

### Slide 3: Equipment & Setup
**Required Equipment Checklist:**
- 3 apple varieties (Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Gala)
- Sharp knife + cutting board
- Camera/smartphone (8MP+ resolution)
- White background/plate
- Ruler for measuring
- Timer and labels

**Setup Requirements:**
- Consistent lighting location
- Clean workspace
- Same time daily (±1 hour)
- Room temperature monitoring

---

### Slide 4: The Cutting Protocol
**Why Standardization Matters:**
- Consistent slice thickness = uniform oxidation exposure
- Same cut direction = comparable surface area
- Center slices = avoid edge effects

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. 0.5-inch thick slices (use ruler!)
2. Cut perpendicular to core (star pattern visible)
3. Use center slices only
4. 3 slices per apple
5. Clean knife between varieties

**Safety First:** Always cut away from body, use stable surface

---

### Slide 5: Photography Standards
**Camera Settings:**
- NO flash (natural/ambient light only)
- High resolution (8MP minimum)
- Sharp focus essential
- 12-18 inches distance

**Composition Rules:**
- Directly above apple (90-degree angle)
- White background only
- Apple fills 60-80% of frame
- No shadows on apple surface
- Take 3 photos per slice, use best

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Using flash photography
- Inconsistent angles
- Poor lighting
- Blurry/out-of-focus images

---

### Slide 6: File Naming & Organization
**Naming Convention:**
```
AppleType_Day_SliceNumber_TeamMember_Date
```

**Examples:**
- `RedDelicious_Day0_Slice1_Sarah_20250920.jpg`
- `GrannySmith_Day3_Slice2_Mike_20250923.jpg`

**Folder Structure:**
```
Apple_Oxidation_Dataset/
├── RedDelicious/Day0-Day6/
├── GrannySmith/Day0-Day6/
└── Gala/Day0-Day6/
```

**Why This Matters:** Proper organization = Easy data processing later

---

### Slide 7: 7-Day Collection Timeline
**Collection Schedule:**
- **Day 0:** Fresh cut baseline (within 15 minutes)
- **Day 1:** 24 hours post-cut
- **Day 2:** 48 hours post-cut
- **Day 3:** 72 hours post-cut
- **Day 4:** 96 hours post-cut
- **Day 5:** 120 hours post-cut
- **Day 6:** 144 hours post-cut

**Time Consistency:** Same time each day (±1 hour maximum)

**Storage Between Sessions:** Refrigerate in open containers, keep varieties separate

---

### Slide 8: Quality Control Standards
**Photo Quality Checklist:**
- ✅ Sharp focus and clear details
- ✅ Consistent lighting across all photos
- ✅ White/clean background
- ✅ No camera shake or motion blur
- ✅ Accurate colors

**Data Quality Requirements:**
- ✅ Complete 7-day sequence
- ✅ All 3 varieties collected
- ✅ Proper file naming
- ✅ Data sheet completed
- ✅ Backup created within 24 hours

---

### Slide 9: Oxidation Scoring System
**Visual Scoring Scale (0-10):**
- **0-1:** Fresh, white/cream color
- **2-3:** Slight yellowing, minimal brown spots
- **4-5:** Moderate browning, color change evident
- **6-7:** Significant browning, texture changes
- **8-9:** Heavy oxidation, major changes
- **10:** Maximum oxidation observed

**What to Look For:**
- Color progression: White → Yellow → Light Brown → Dark Brown
- Texture changes: Firm → Soft → Mushy
- Surface condition: Smooth → Rough → Deteriorated

---

### Slide 10: Common Problems & Solutions
**Lighting Issues:**
- Problem: Inconsistent lighting between days
- Solution: Use same location/time, avoid flash

**Focus Problems:**
- Problem: Blurry or out-of-focus photos
- Solution: Use macro mode, steady hands

**Apple Quality Issues:**
- Problem: Unexpected mold or deterioration
- Solution: Proper refrigeration, air circulation
