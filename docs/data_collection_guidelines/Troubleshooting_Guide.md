## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if I can't cut exactly 0.5-inch slices?
**A:** Aim for consistency within your collection round. Document actual thickness and maintain same thickness throughout your 7-day collection.

### Q: Can I use different cameras for the same collection round?
**A:** Avoid if possible. If you must switch, take test photos to ensure similar quality and color accuracy.

### Q: What if my apples are different sizes?
**A:** This is normal and acceptable. Document apple variety and approximate size. Consistency within each apple is more important than matching across varieties.

### Q: Should I continue if oxidation looks unusual?
**A:** Yes! Unusual patterns are still valuable data. Document carefully and continue collection as planned.

### Q: What if I miss more than one day?
**A:** Consult with team lead. You may need to start a new collection round rather than continuing with large gaps.
