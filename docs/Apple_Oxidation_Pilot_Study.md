# üß™ Apple Oxidation Pilot Study
## Test Run to Determine Optimal Photo Schedule

### üéØ **Purpose**
Determine the actual oxidation rate of different apple types at room temperature to plan the best photo collection schedule for ML training.

### üçé **Pilot Materials**
- **1 Gala apple**
- **1 Granny Smith apple** 
- **1 Red Delicious apple**
- Camera/phone
- White background
- Labels

---

## üìÖ **7-Day Pilot Schedule**

### **Day 0 (Baseline - Fresh)**
**For each apple:**
1. Take 2 photos: whole apple
2. Cut apple in half horizontally
3. Take 4 photos: both cut surfaces
4. Label and leave on counter at room temperature
5. **Note the time** you cut each apple

**Goal:** Establish fresh baseline

---

### **Days 1-6 (Oxidation Monitoring)**
**Every 12 hours** (morning and evening):
1. Take 4 photos: both cut surfaces
2. **Rate oxidation level** (0-10 scale):
   - 0 = Fresh (no browning)
   - 3 = Light browning (edges only)
   - 6 = Medium browning (noticeable across surface)
   - 10 = Heavy browning (significant color change)
3. **Note observations:**
   - Color changes
   - Texture changes
   - Any differences between apple types

**Total pilot photos:** ~50-60 photos

## üîç **What We'll Learn**

### **Oxidation Rate Questions:**
- How fast does each apple type brown?
- When do we see "light" vs "medium" vs "heavy" oxidation?
- Are there differences between apple varieties?
- What's the optimal photo timing?

### **Possible Outcomes:**

**If oxidation is FAST (significant browning in 24-48 hours):**
- Stick with 3-day plan
- Maybe add more frequent photos (every 12 hours)

**If oxidation is SLOW (takes 4-7 days for heavy browning):**
- Extend to 5-7 day collection plan
- Space photos further apart

**If oxidation varies by apple type:**
- Different schedules for different apple varieties
- Focus on the most consistent variety

## üìã **Pilot Study Checklist**

### **Preparation:**
- [ ] Buy 3 apples (1 of each type)
- [ ] Set up consistent photo station
- [ ] Create data collection sheet
- [ ] Set phone reminders for 12-hour intervals

### **During Pilot (7 days):**
- [ ] Take photos every 12 hours
- [ ] Rate oxidation levels consistently  
- [ ] Note environmental factors (temperature, humidity)
- [ ] Document any unexpected changes

### **Analysis:**
- [ ] Review all photos chronologically
- [ ] Identify optimal "fresh," "light," and "heavy" time points
- [ ] Plan final data collection schedule
- [ ] Adjust photo frequency if needed

## üéØ **Expected Timeline for Pilot Results**

**Week 1:** Pilot study (3 apples, monitoring only)
**Week 2:** Analyze results and plan final collection  
**Week 3:** Execute optimized data collection (9 apples)
**Week 4:** Train ML model with collected data

---

## üí° **Smart Scientific Approach Benefits**

1. **Evidence-based planning** instead of guessing
2. **Optimal photo timing** for maximum data quality
3. **Apple variety insights** - some may brown faster
4. **Reduced waste** - only 3 apples for testing
5. **Better ML training data** from informed schedule
