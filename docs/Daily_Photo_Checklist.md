# ðŸ“‹ Apple Photo Collection - 3 Day Process

## One-Time Purchase: 9 Apples Total

### Day 0 (Purchase Day - Fresh Apples) âœ…
**Repeat this process for ALL 9 apples (3 Gala, 3 Granny Smith, 3 Red Delicious):**

**Per Apple Process:**
- [ ] **Photo 1:** Whole apple - front view
- [ ] **Photo 2:** Whole apple - top view
- [ ] Cut apple in half horizontally  
- [ ] **Photo 3:** First half cut surface - straight on
- [ ] **Photo 4:** First half cut surface - slight angle
- [ ] **Photo 5:** Second half cut surface - straight on
- [ ] **Photo 6:** Second half cut surface - slight angle
- [ ] Label apple type on paper next to cut halves
- [ ] Leave both halves on counter (room temperature)

**Files saved:** 54 photos total (6 photos Ã— 9 apples)

---

### Day 1 (Light Oxidation - 24 hours later) âœ…
**For EACH cut apple (should show browning around edges):**
- [ ] Take photo: first cut surface (angle 1)
- [ ] Take photo: first cut surface (angle 2)
- [ ] Take photo: second cut surface (angle 1)  
- [ ] Take photo: second cut surface (angle 2)
- [ ] Leave on counter for continued oxidation

**Files saved:** 36 photos total (4 per apple)

---

### Day 2 (Heavy Oxidation - 48 hours later) âœ…
**For EACH cut apple (should show significant browning):**
- [ ] Take photo: first cut surface (angle 1)
- [ ] Take photo: first cut surface (angle 2)
- [ ] Take photo: second cut surface (angle 1)
- [ ] Take photo: second cut surface (angle 2)
- [ ] Dispose of apple (completed data collection)

**Files saved:** 36 photos total (4 per apple)

## ðŸ“Š 3-Day Summary  
- **Total photos collected:** 126 photos
- **Fresh apples (Day 0):** 54 photos
- **Light oxidation (Day 1):** 36 photos
- **Heavy oxidation (Day 2):** 36 photos

## ðŸ”„ Optional: More Data
If you want additional training data:
- Wait 2 weeks and repeat with fresh apples
- Or collect photos from friends/family doing the same process
- 126 photos should be sufficient for good ML training!

**One 3-day collection = Complete dataset!** âš¡
