## 🔍 **Key Observations**

### **1. Pattern: Systematic Underestimation**
- Model consistently predicts **lower** days than actual
- All predictions are in 0.34-1.25 day range
- Actual values are 1-4 days
- Model seems "stuck" predicting fresh apples

### **2. Day 1 Performance**
- **Both Day 1 predictions were "Good"** (0.54-0.59 error)
- Model is reasonably accurate for fresh apples
- Error increases dramatically after Day 1

### **3. Days 2-4 Performance**
- **All predictions severely underestimate age**
- Error grows from 1.65 days (Day 2) to 3.16 days (Day 4)
- Model appears unable to detect oxidation beyond ~1 day

## 🤔 **Why Is The Model Failing?**

### **Hypothesis 1: Apple Variety Difference**
**Most Likely Cause**

- Training data: Mix of Gala + Granny Smith
- Test data: Only Granny Smith
- **Granny Smith oxidizes SLOWER** than Gala
  - Green apples show less visible browning
  - Takes longer to develop oxidation color
  - Model trained on faster-oxidizing Galas

**Evidence:**
- Training validation MAE was 0.777 days
- Test MAE is 1.90 days (2.4× worse!)
- Model thinks apples are "fresher" than they are

### **Hypothesis 2: Different Environmental Conditions**
**Possible Contributing Factor**

- Different lighting between training and test
- Different camera setup
- Different storage temperature/humidity
- Different apple freshness at purchase

### **Hypothesis 3: Limited Training Data**
**Structural Issue**

- Only 88 training photos
- Only 11 time points
- Not enough variety for robust generalization
- Model overfits to specific training conditions

---

## 💡 **Recommendations for Improvement**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Collect More Granny Smith Training Data**
   - Add these 8 test photos to training set
   - Retrain model with mixed Gala + Granny Smith
   - This should improve Granny Smith performance

2. **Collect More Gala Test Data**
   - Test if model performs better on Gala apples
   - Compare Gala vs Granny Smith accuracy
   - Validate apple variety hypothesis

3. **Extend Collection Timeline**
   - Current training: 0-5 days
   - Test data: 1-4 days
   - Collect photos up to 7 days for better coverage

### **Long-Term Improvements:**

1. **Larger Dataset**
   - Target: 200-300 photos minimum
   - Multiple apple varieties
   - Various environmental conditions

2. **Data Augmentation**
   - Lighting variations
   - Rotation/flip transformations
   - Color adjustments

3. **Multi-Output Model**
   - Predict BOTH days AND apple variety
   - Model learns variety-specific oxidation patterns
   - Better generalization
